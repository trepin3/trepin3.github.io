## 1. Google Ads Campaign Strategy

### Campaign Type: Call-Only Campaigns

Call-only campaigns are optimized to drive phone calls, not website clicks. For a local service business, phone calls convert at 3-5x the rate of form submissions.

**Setup Steps:**
1. Go to [ads.google.com](https://ads.google.com) → New Campaign → Leads → Phone Calls
2. Set your business phone number (must be verified)
3. Set location targeting: Arizona (or specific cities below)
4. Set language: English
5. Set bidding: Maximize conversions (start here, switch to Target CPA after 30 conversions)

### Keywords (organized by city)

**Phoenix Metro:**
- drone photography phoenix
- aerial photography phoenix az
- real estate drone photos phoenix
- drone photographer near me
- aerial real estate photography phoenix
- drone video real estate phoenix

**Scottsdale:**
- drone photography scottsdale
- aerial photography scottsdale az
- luxury real estate drone scottsdale
- aerial photos scottsdale homes

**Tucson:**
- drone photography tucson
- aerial real estate photography tucson
- drone photographer tucson az

**Mesa / Chandler / Gilbert:**
- drone photography mesa az
- aerial photography chandler
- real estate drone photos gilbert

**General Arizona:**

- real estate drone photography arizona
- aerial listing photos arizona
- drone videography real estate az
- property drone photos near me

### Negative Keywords (add these immediately)

```

### Budget & Bidding

| Setting | Recommendation |
|---------|---------------|
| Daily budget | $15-25/day to start ($450-750/month) |
| Expected CPC | $3-8 per click |
| Expected call cost | $15-40 per call |
| Target calls/day | 3-8 |
| Conversion rate | 20-35% of calls book a shoot |

### Ad Schedule

- **Active days:** Monday through Saturday
- **Active hours:** 7:00 AM - 7:00 PM MST
- **Bid boost +25%:** 9:00 AM - 12:00 PM (when agents are most active planning listings)
- **Off:** Sundays (low real estate activity)

### Conversion Tracking Setup

1. In Google Ads, go to Tools → Conversions → New Conversion Action
2. Select "Phone calls" → "Calls from ads or a website"
3. Set call duration threshold: 60 seconds (filters out accidental clicks)
4. Install the Google Ads tag on your website (already templated in index.html, just uncomment and add your ID)
5. Add the conversion action ID to script.js where marked with `AW-XXXXXXXXXX/YYYYYYY`

### Optimization Tips

- **Week 1-2:** Let campaigns run without changes to gather data
- **Week 3:** Pause keywords with >$50 spend and 0 conversions
- **Week 4:** Add top-performing search terms as exact match keywords
- **Monthly:** Review search terms report, add negatives, adjust bids
- **After 30 conversions:** Switch to Target CPA bidding

## 2. Free Advertising Strategies

### Google Business Profile (Highest Priority — Do This First)

Your Google Business Profile (GBP) is the single most impactful free marketing channel. It shows up in Google Maps and the local 3-pack above organic results.

**Setup Steps:**
1. Go to [business.google.com](https://business.google.com)
2. Create profile for "Merchant Skyview Media"
3. **Category:** Primary: "Photographer" | Additional: "Aerial Photographer", "Real Estate Photographer"
4. **Service area:** List all 12 cities (Phoenix, Scottsdale, Tucson, Mesa, Chandler, Gilbert, Tempe, Surprise, Peoria, Goodyear, Flagstaff, Sedona)
5. **Description:** "Professional drone photography and videography for Arizona real estate. FAA Part 107 certified, $1M insured. Aerial photos, videos, 360 virtual tours, and construction progress documentation. 24-hour delivery. Serving Phoenix, Scottsdale, Tucson, and all of Arizona."
6. **Photos:** Upload 10+ portfolio photos (aerial shots), your logo, and team photos
7. **Hours:** Mon-Sat 7AM-7PM, Sun Closed

**Ongoing GBP Strategy:**
- Post 1-2 Google Posts per week (portfolio photo + brief description + CTA)
- Ask every satisfied client for a Google review (send link via text immediately after delivery)
- Respond to every review within 24 hours
- Update photos monthly with new work
- Use Google Posts for seasonal promotions or new service announcements

### Instagram Strategy

**Profile Setup:**
- Business account → @merchantskyview (or similar)
- Bio: "Drone Photography for AZ Real Estate 📍Phoenix | FAA Certified | 24hr Delivery | Book below ⬇️"
- Link in bio: trepin3.github.io
- Contact button: Phone number

**Content Mix (3-5 posts per week):**
- 60% — Portfolio shots (best drone photos, before/after)
- 20% — Behind the scenes (drone setup, flight prep, editing process)
- 10% — Tips for agents ("Why aerial photos sell homes faster")
- 10% — Testimonials / results (overlay quote on photo)

**Reels Strategy:**
- Post 2-3 Reels per week (15-30 seconds each)
- Content: Smooth flyover clips, takeoff/landing, reveal shots
- Use trending audio when relevant
- Always include location tag + relevant hashtags

**Hashtag Strategy (use 15-20 per post, rotate sets):**
```
#dronePhotography #aerialPhotography #realEstatePhotography
#arizonaRealestate #phoenixRealEstate #scottsdaleLuxury
#dronePilot #droneLife #arizonaDrone #realtorMarketing
#listingPhotos #justListed #newListing #homesForSale
#droneVideo #aerialVideo #realEstateVideo
#phoenixHomes #scottsdalehomes #arizonaHomes
```

### Facebook Strategy

1. Create a Facebook Business Page
2. Join local real estate groups:
   - "Arizona Real Estate Agents"
   - "Phoenix Real Estate Networking"
   - "Scottsdale Real Estate Professionals"
   - Search for groups in each target city
3. **Don't spam.** Share value first — post a great aerial photo and say "Shot this today in Scottsdale. Aerial photos make such a difference for luxury listings." Let people come to you.
4. Run a monthly "Free Listing Photo Giveaway" — pick one agent to receive a free Basic package in exchange for a review and social media mention

### TikTok Strategy

- Repurpose Instagram Reels (adjust aspect ratio if needed)
- Post 3-5x/week with trending sounds
- Content ideas: dramatic drone reveals, sunset property shots, "day in the life of a drone pilot"
- Use popular hooks: "POV: You're a drone photographer in Arizona" / "Wait for the reveal..."
- Always include "link in bio" verbal/text CTA

### YouTube Strategy

- Upload full property tour videos (1-3 minutes each)
- Title format: "Stunning Aerial Tour | [Address] | [City], AZ | Drone Photography"
- Detailed descriptions with keywords: location, property type, services
- Create playlists by city ("Phoenix Aerial Tours", "Scottsdale Luxury Properties")
- Acts as both portfolio and SEO channel (YouTube is the #2 search engine)

### Free Directories & Listings

Register on ALL of these (costs nothing, generates leads):

| Directory | URL | Priority |
|-----------|-----|----------|
| Google Business Profile | business.google.com | Must-have |
| Yelp | yelp.com/biz | High |

**Ensure NAP Consistency:** Your Name, Address, and Phone number must be **identical** across all listings (same formatting, same phone number).

### Local SEO Strategy

- Keep business name, address, phone consistent everywhere (NAP consistency)
- Build citations on directories above
- JSON-LD structured data is already in the website
- Create location-specific content if you expand to a blog later
- Earn backlinks by getting featured in local real estate publications

## 7. Arizona Market Analysis

### City-by-City Breakdown

| City | Strategy | Avg Home Price | Notes |
|------|----------|---------------|-------|
| **Phoenix** | Volume play | $400-500K | Largest market, most agents, most competition. Cast wide net. |
| **Scottsdale** | Premium/luxury | $700K-2M+ | Higher prices = higher willingness to pay for premium packages. Lead with $599 Premium. |
| **Tucson** | Less competition | $300-400K | Fewer drone photographers. Easier to dominate. Good early market. |
| **Mesa** | Suburban/new construction | $400-500K | Lots of new builds. Good for construction progress + residential combo. |
| **Chandler** | Suburban families | $450-550K | Growing market. Good for Standard package. |
| **Gilbert** | New construction | $450-600K | Rapidly growing. Target new home builders + agents. |
| **Tempe** | Mixed (condos + homes) | $350-500K | Near ASU. Smaller residential market but good for commercial. |
| **Surprise/Peoria/Goodyear** | Emerging suburbs | $350-450K | Growing fast. Less competition. Get in early. |
| **Flagstaff** | Seasonal/niche | $500-700K | Mountain properties look amazing from above. Seasonal (spring-fall). |
| **Sedona** | Luxury/tourism | $700K-1.5M+ | Stunning landscape = stunning aerials. Premium pricing justified. |

### Seasonal Strategy

**Peak Season (October – May):**
- Real estate market is most active
- Snowbirds arrive, buying activity peaks
- Run full Google Ads budget
- Network aggressively
- This is when 70% of your revenue will come

**Slow Season (June – September):**
- 110°F+ heat reduces outdoor shoots
- Shoot early morning (5-8 AM) to avoid heat and get golden hour
- Pivot to construction progress work (builders don't stop for summer)
- Reduce Google Ads budget by 40-50%
- Focus on content creation, portfolio building, relationship nurturing
- Offer "summer specials" to maintain some volume

### Competitor Landscape

| Competitor | Positioning | Price Range | Your Advantage |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| Phoenix Drone Pros | Full-service, established | $250-800 | Faster delivery, more personal service, competitive pricing |
| Extreme Aerial Productions | High-end video production | $500-2000+ | More affordable, focused on real estate, faster turnaround |
| Arizona Listing Media | Real estate media company | $200-600 | Specialized in aerial (their expertise is split), more responsive |
| iSky Films | Video-first production | $400-1500 | Real estate focused, simpler packages, 24-hour delivery |

**Your Positioning:** "Same quality as the big studios, faster delivery, personal service, better price."

### Pricing Benchmarks (Arizona Market)

|------|------------|------------|----------|
| Entry | $150-250 | $199 | Competitive entry point |
